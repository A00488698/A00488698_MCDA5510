## Introduction

My name is Yaxuan Zhang, but you can also call me Sarah Zhang. I’m from Hebei, in the northern part of China. I graduated with a degree in Computer Science, and after university, I worked at an insurance company for four years, eventually becoming a department director. During that time, I gained valuable experience in data handling, creating reports, and providing data-driven analysis. I also developed strong interpersonal skills, but I felt my technical growth had stalled, which affected my confidence. Although I don’t have extensive technical experience, I love diving deep into learning and have high standards for myself—I won’t stop until I achieve my goals. I’m a responsible person, though sometimes I lack the courage to start. However, once I begin, I continuously push myself forward. My preferred email is Yaxuan.Zhang@smu.ca, and my A number is A00488698.

## Technology Interest

I'm particularly interested in learning more about advanced technologies to streamline work processes and enhance efficiency. Given my background in data handling, I'm eager to explore more sophisticated techniques and tools. Additionally, I have a keen interest in AI and hope to delve into this field to make our lives and work easier through innovative solutions.

## Fun Fact

I can sleep for more than 14 hours at a stretch!
